# ExerciseApp
This is the repo for my Exercise App in Web Programming for the Fall 2021 semester.

## Planned Screens and Features
It is difficult to know all of the features or screens that the website will have, so these are a few ideas I had when looking into the progress of the website so far. Unitracker can be a possible name, Universal Exercise Tracker.

I plan on adding a Home screen, Fitness Tracking screen, Nutrition Tracking screen, Data Reports screen, Available Trainers screen, Settings, Help, and Contact Us Page.

A few features in my exercise tracker app that will seperate mine from the others are: stopwatch activity tracking, nutrition page to add specific foods, daily exercise goals (minutes of exercise and calories burned), a page of available trainers to help your progress.
